- [Security Observability and the Mystery of Detection as Code](https://www.observeinc.com/blog/dac-and-security-observability/)

    The article discusses Detection as Code (DaC) as a potential tool to boost Security Observability. While DaC offers benefits like versioning and modularity for detection rules, achieving cross-vendor or cross-tool sharing remains a hurdle due to economic and technical constraints.  Jack Coates argues that DaC might hold more promise for internal collaboration within organizations using Security Observability, where a shared language like Sigma can promote team communication.
